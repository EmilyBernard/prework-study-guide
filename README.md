# Prework Study Guide Webpage
## A study guide for course prework

##Description
This Prework Study guide was created for boot camp students who were going through Prework.  It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.
It will keep notes from the student in a single webpage, easily accessible to the student.
It displayes the notes in a clear, visually organized manner.
I learned to code in 4 different ways and how these 4 coding tecniques relate to each other.

To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
